Project README
This is the README file for the current project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in developing a static website using HTML.

The project is a recipe website that provides information on various recipes such as appetizers, main dishes, desserts, and beverages. The website will have different pages for each category of recipes, and each page will contain a list of recipes along with their ingredients and instructions. Additionally, the website will have a search bar that allows users to search for recipes based on keywords and categories.

In order to complete this project, I will be demonstrating several skills, including:

HTML markup language for creating web pages and their structure
Creating and organizing content, such as text and images, in an easy-to-navigate manner
Creating links and menus to navigate between web page
